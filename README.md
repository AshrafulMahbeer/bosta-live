AynaOTT is back!
This repo is just an example of how you can generate a playlist for yourself. Due to their security in certain channels, all of these generated links may not work always. So I set up another serverless function on vercel which bypasses that security and will work 100%. The link to that playlist is given below. This will generate link for you everytime you choose a channel. So, the generated link will be fresh.
Cheers!

## Playlist link
https://aynaxpranto.vercel.app/files/playlist.m3u

### Shortened link
https://rebrand.ly/AynaNS <br />
https://rebrand.ly/AynaVLC

Any of these above links will work on all iptv players as long as you paste this link properly.
